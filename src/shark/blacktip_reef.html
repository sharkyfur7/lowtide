  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The blacktip reef shark is a pretty cool shark that is easily identifiable
    by the black tips of it's fins. They're TINY compared to other sharks,
    usually not longer than 1.6 meters. And their pups are adorable!

    Unfortunately the
    <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/39375/58303674" target="_blank"
      >IUCN</a
    >
    has marked the blacktip reef shark as
    <span class="warning">vulnerable and declining</span> due to their low
    reproductive rate and overfishing :(

  <h2>Diet</h2>
  <p>
    Their diet consists mainly of small fish üêü. Rarely they eat things like
    squid, shrimp and smaller sharks. Sometimes they'll snack on a sea snake or
    two! Company of others isn't a problem either, groups of blacktip reef
    sharks have been seen herding fish towards shore for easier feeding.

  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <p>
    They live around coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific and tolerate lower
    salinity. Unlike other reef sharks they like being in shallow waters. So
    sometimes they go to mangroves when the tide rises. During low tide they
    mostly chill at coral reefs. Occasionally they like an area so much that
    they'll stay there for several years.
