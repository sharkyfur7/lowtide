          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The blacktip reef shark is a pretty cool shark that is easily
            identifiable by the black tips of it's fins. They're TINY compared
            to other sharks, usually not longer than 1.6 meters. And their pups
            are adorable!
          </p>

            Unfortunately the

              target="_blank"
              >IUCN</a
            >
            has marked the blacktip reef shark as
            <span class="warning">vulnerable and declining</span> due to their
            low reproductive rate and overfishing :(

          <h2>Diet</h2>
          <p>
            Their diet consists mainly of small fish üêü. Rarely they eat things
            like squid, shrimp and smaller sharks. Sometimes they'll snack on a
            sea snake or two! Company of others isn't a problem either, groups
            of blacktip reef sharks have been seen herding fish towards shore
            for easier feeding.
          </p>

          <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <p>
            They live around coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific and tolerate lower
            salinity. Unlike other reef sharks they like being in shallow
            waters. So sometimes they go to mangroves when the tide rises.
            During low tide they mostly chill at coral reefs. Occasionally they
            like an area so much that they'll stay there for several years.
