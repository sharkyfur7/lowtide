            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The blacktip reef shark is a pretty cool shark that is easily
              identifiable by the black tips of it's fins. They're TINY compared
              to other sharks, usually not longer than 1.6 meters. And their
              pups are adorable!
            </p>

              Unfortunately the

                >IUCN</a
              >
              has marked the blacktip reef shark as
              <span class="warning">vulnerable and declining</span> due to their
              low reproductive rate and overfishing :(

            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>
              Their diet consists mainly of small fish üêü. Rarely they eat
              things like squid, shrimp and smaller sharks. Sometimes they'll
              snack on a sea snake or two! Company of others isn't a problem
              either, groups of blacktip reef sharks have been seen herding fish
              towards shore for easier feeding.

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>
              They live around coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific and tolerate
              lower salinity. Unlike other reef sharks they like being in
              shallow waters. So sometimes they go to mangroves when the tide
              rises. During low tide they mostly chill at coral reefs.
              Occasionally they like an area so much that they'll stay there for
              several years.
