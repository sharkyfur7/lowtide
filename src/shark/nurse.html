          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The nurse shark is a pretty calm and friendly species of shark. They
            are timid bottom dwellers and have jaws filled with lots of tiny
            sharp teeth. They can also pump water over their gills eliminating
            the need to move to be able to breate. Be careful! Attacks by this
            species are usually caused by careless divers not respecting the
            animal.

            Unfortunately many shark species are threatened and the nurse shark
            is no exception... The

          <h2>Diet</h2>
          <p>
            The nurse shark's diet consists primarily of small fish üêü,
            crustaceans ü¶Ä and occasionally even algae. They are nocturnal,
            searching for food on the sea floor during night. They have the
            ability to create suction and suck algae off of corals or sift
            through the sediments on the sea floor.

          <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <p>
            These little guys usually stay inshore. The pups stick to coral
            reefs or seagrass flats whereas the older sharks tend to stay at
            deeper reefs leaving their shelter to feed in shallower areas during
            night. Interestingly they also have something typical of reef
            sharks: site fidelity, a tendency to stick to a particular area. And
            it is also one of the few sharks that exhibits mating site fidelity,
            returning to the same area to breed.
